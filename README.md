Overview

The Loan Approval System is a Python-based application designed to automate and streamline the loan approval process for a financial institution. This system leverages machine learning to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on various applicant factors and historical data. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface for bank employees to input applicant information and receive instant loan approval decisions.
